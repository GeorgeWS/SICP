Variables:

n = number of kinds of coins
a = amount to change
d = denomination of first kind of coin

Algorithm:

The number of ways to change amount a using n kinds of coins equals…
- the number of ways to change amount a using all but the first kind of coin, plus
- the number of ways to change amount a-d using all n kinds of coins.

Degenerate rules:

- if a=0, there is 1 way to change a
- if a<0, there are 0 ways to change a
- if n=0, there are 0 ways to change a

Example:
